\section{TBD}
This section provides an outline of the TBD platform, a framework for incremental computation currently being developed at CMU. The framework is being developed in the Scala language, which enables us to exploit the reflection capabilities of Scala for analysis \cite{burmako2013scala}. 

\subsection{Programming interface}
This subsection is going to describe the TBD core API. Since TBD relies on the use of patterns known from functional languages, these patterns should be described. Also, the constraints for and the responsibilities of the developer have to be specified. The section should be concluded with an example.
