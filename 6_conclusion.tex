\section{Conclusion}
This section should conclude with the findings of the executed benchmarks. Furthermore, it should provide a guideline for choosing one of the two frameworks, depending on which type of algorithm is to be implemented. 

\subsection{Future work}
The final section should shortly outline problems encountered but not solved during the writing of this theses, as well as encourage future research on interesting issues of incremental computation.
