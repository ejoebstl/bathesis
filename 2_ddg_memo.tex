\section{Theoretic funcdamentals}
\label{sec:ddg_memo}
This section should give a brief summarization of the principles described in the work of U. Acar et al. This section is important, because we later have to adjust definitions found here to fit the program model of TBD. \cite{Acar2005thesis}

\subsection{Theoretical program model}
This subsection should describe the underlying theoretical program model. 

\subsection{Approach for incremental computation}
This subsection should describe the approaches of using Traces, DDGs (Directed Dependency Graphs) and memoization together to accomplish incremental computing. 

\subsection{Stable algorithms}
This subsection should describe the concepts of stable algorithms, intrinsic trace distance and their relationship. 

It should especially be made clear, that the intrinsic trace distance forms a lower bound for the time needed by change propagation during an update.
