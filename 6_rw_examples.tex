\section{Evaluation}
This section should demonstrate the usefullness of the described techniques using real-world algorithms, like map, reduce and quicksort. 

Basically, it should be demonstrated how it is possible to optimize a classic implementation (without memoization) of each algorithm, so that change propagation time lies within the same complexity class as the theoretical lower bound for updates for this algorithm.
