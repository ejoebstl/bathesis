\section{Evaluation}
This section is going to demonstrate the usefulness of the described techniques using real-world algorithms, like map, reduce and quicksort. 

Basically, it is shown how it is possible to optimize a classic implementation (without memorization) of each algorithm, so that change propagation time lies within the same complexity class as the theoretical lower bound for updates for this algorithm.
