\section{Introduction}
This section should describe the purpose of incremental computation and also explain for which purpose the concept of incremental computation is useful. Also, used and referenced terminology should be outlined.  

\subsection{Approaches to incremental computation}
This subsection should briefly describe various approaches to incremental computation, and outline their strengths and weaknesses. Also, some newer implementations of incremental computation platforms should be outlined. \cite{heydon2000caching} \cite{acar2004dynamizing} \cite{acar2006adaptive} \cite{cohen1991dynamic} \cite{liu1995systematic} \cite{naiadIncremental} \cite{Chen2014} \cite{Pugh1989}
