\section{Conducted experiments}
This section should outline important properties of algorithms used for this benchmark, and why these features are important. 

Note: The testcases listed here are subject to change. 

Each subsection should describe the differences and challenges of the implementations for Naiad and TBD. 

\subsection{Wordcount}
Wordcount was choosen as a benchmark because many machine-learning approaches rely on wordcount on big data. Furthermore, wordcount serves as a prime example of an algorithm implemented on top of map-reduce. 

\subsection{Sorting numbers}
A sorting algorithm (quicksort or mergesort, has yet to be decided) was chosen as benchmark because it introduces a special form of difficulties for incremental computation: If the input of a sorting operation changes, the dependency graph is expected to change.

\subsection{Pagerank}
Pagerank is an algorithm highly relevant for real-world applications. Futhermore, it is also prone to cascading updates, which makes it an interesting benchmark for incremental computation platforms.
