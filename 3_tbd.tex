\section{TBD}
This section should outline the TBD framework, a framework for incremental computation currently being developed at CMU. The framework is being developed in the Scala language. This enables us to exploit the relection capabilties of Scala for analysis \cite{burmako2013scala}. 

\subsection{Programming interface}
This subsection should describe the TBD core API. Since TBD relies on the use of patterns known from functional languages, these patterns should be described. Also, the constraints for and the responsibilites of the developer have to be specified. The section should be concluded with an example. 

\subsection{Program model}
This subsection should describe a program model for TBD, which can be used for theoretical conclusions in the following sections. The differences and similarities with the programming model in section \ref{sec:ddg_memo} should be highlighted.
