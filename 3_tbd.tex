\section{TBD}
This section should outline the TBD framework. 

\subsection{Approach}
This subsection should describe the approach TBD uses, especially on how memoization and the tracing of dependency graphs can be used to achieve incremental computation. 

\subsection{Programming model}
This subsection should describe the TBD core API. Since TBD relies on the use of patterns known from functional languages, these patterns should be described. Also, the constraints for and the responsibilites of the developer have to be specified. The section should be concluded with an example. 

\subsection{Prerequisites for implementing performant algorithms on top of TBD}
This subsection should provide a very short outline to the term \textit{stable algorithm}.
