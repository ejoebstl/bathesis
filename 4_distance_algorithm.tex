\section{An Intrinsic trace distance algorithm for TBD}
This section should describe an algorithm for calculating the minimal trace distance of traces produced by TBD. Also, implementation details and challenges during the implementation (like comparing functions for equality) should be discussed. The definition of intrinsic trace distance can be found in \cite{Acar2005thesis}, chapter 7. 

\subsection{Proof of correctness}
We shall also proof the correctness of our algorithm. It is of importance that we take the changes in the program model into account.
