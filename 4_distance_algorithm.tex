\section{An Intrinsic trace distance algorithm for TBD}
This section is going to describe our algorithm for calculating the minimal trace distance of execution traces produced by TBD. Also, implementation details and challenges during the implementation (like defining equality for anonymous functions with free variables in practice) should be discussed.

\subsection{Proof of correctness}
We shall also proof the correctness of our algorithm. It is of importance that we take the changes of the program model outlined in the previous section into account.
