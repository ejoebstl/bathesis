The principle of incremental programming has been well known for many years. While the autmation transformation of imperative programs into fast incremental programs is not solved in general, a number of platforms for incremental computation have been created. In this document, we inspect the incremental computation platform TBD. First, we summarize known principles like directed depenedency graphs, execution traces, intrinsic trace distance and trace stability, then we create an program model which enables us to apply those principles to TBD programs. We also present an algorithm to calculate the intrinsic trace distance in practice and how we can make automatic optimizations to prorgrams by analyzing the dependency graph.
