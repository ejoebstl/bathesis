The principle of incremental programming has been well known for many years. While the automatic transformation of sequential programs into efficient incremental programs is not solved in general, a number of platforms for incremental computation have been created. In this document, we inspect the incremental computation platform TBD. First, we summarize known principles like directed dependency graphs, execution traces, intrinsic trace distance and trace stability, then we create an program model which enables us to apply those principles to TBD programs. We also present an algorithm to calculate the intrinsic trace distance in practice. Finally, we show how we can make automatic optimizations to programs by analyzing the dependency graph.
