\section{Automatic optimization of algorithms}
This section should describe how analyzing the DDG can be used for automatic optimization, or at least to give hints for possible optimization to the developer. 

The exact contents of this chapter are still to be determined, based on our findings. Possible approaches include, but may not be limited to: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Operation reordering.
\item Insertion of memorization commands.
\item Detection of cascading updates, which could be omitted. 
\end{itemize}
