\section{NAIAD}
This section should outline the Naiad framework and it's purpose. 

\subsection{Approach}
This subsection should shortly explain the approach Naiad uses, especially in regard of incremental computation. 
In other words, parallel and distributed features of Naiad should not be described in depth, because they are not a matter of interest for this theseis. 

\subsection{Programming model}
This subsection should describe the programming model of Naiad. The description should be from the view of a developer who creates software atop of the platform. The concepts and used programming patterns should be explained clearly, also an example should be provided. 

Frameworks build on top of Naiad, for example the Liandi framework should be mentioned.
