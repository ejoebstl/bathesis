\section{Benchmark results}
This section should clearly describe the testing environment. Also, the input data to the tests should be characterized.

\subsection{Speed}
This section should describe the results in regard to processing time. If there are strong deviations during testing, the cause should be explained. 

\subsection{Memory}
This section should describe the results in regard to memory usage. This section should also expand on anomalies. 

\subsection{Code overhead}
Additionally to processing speed and memory usage, the difference of code overhead between the platform dependend implementations should be measured.
